# README

This is a simple kernel module which will print all the information of specific process.
The user has to give process id as an argument while inserting this module into the system.

## Compilation (Building the .ko module)
```
make
```
This step will generate get_process_info_module.ko file 

## Clean the build
```
make clean
```

## Installation
```
insmod get_process_info_module.ko pid=<process id num> or modprobe get_process_info_module.ko pid=<process id num>
```
## Removing the module from the system
```
rmmod get_process_info_module.ko or modprobe -r get_process_info_module.ko
```

## Log messages
User can see all the module messages into kernel log using dmesg command.
```
dmesg
```

## Test result
```
